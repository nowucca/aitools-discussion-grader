# Comprehensive TODO List - Discussion Grading System

Based on current analysis (63/63 tests passing), here's what's actually left to implement:

## âœ… COMPLETED (Much More Than Expected!)

### Phase 1: Core Architecture (100% Complete)
- âœ… Project structure and configuration
- âœ… Discussion Manager (create, list, show, update discussions)
- âœ… AI Integration (grade submissions with Claude API)
- âœ… Discussion Controller (all CRUD operations)
- âœ… Submission Grader (grade files and text, save submissions)
- âœ… Submission Controller (grade, list, show submissions)
- âœ… CLI Framework (complete Click setup with all commands)
- âœ… Multiple output formats (text, JSON, CSV, table)
- âœ… Comprehensive unit tests (63 tests passing)

### Phase 2: Enhanced Grading (85% Complete)
- âœ… File-based submission grading
- âœ… Text-based submission grading (from clipboard)
- âœ… Submission storage and retrieval
- âœ… Submission listing and details
- âœ… Grade report formatting
- âœ… Word count checking and validation
- âœ… CLI commands for all submission operations

## ðŸ”„ REMAINING WORK

### Phase 2: Enhanced Grading (15% Remaining)

#### 2.1: Interactive Batch Grading Mode
**Priority: High** - This is the main missing piece users expect

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement interactive clipboard-based grading in `controllers/submission.py`
- [ ] Add `grade_text` command to CLI that reads from clipboard
- [ ] Implement grading loop with user prompts (continue/stop/retry)
- [ ] Add clipboard integration with pyperclip
- [ ] Migrate `interactive_grading_loop()` from `batch_grade.py`
- [ ] Test interactive mode with real clipboard operations

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours

#### 2.2: Advanced Submission Management
**Priority: Medium**

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add filtering options to submission listing (by grade range, word count)
- [ ] Implement submission deletion functionality
- [ ] Add bulk operations (delete multiple, regrade multiple)

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours

### Phase 3: Synthesis & Reporting (0% Complete)

#### 3.1: Basic Report Generation
**Priority: High** - Core feature for instructors

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement `lib/reporting.py` with `ReportGenerator` class
- [ ] Add submission synthesis using Claude API
- [ ] Implement filtering by grade thresholds
- [ ] Add chunking for large submission sets (handle token limits)
- [ ] Create unit tests for report generation

**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 hours

#### 3.2: Report Controller and CLI
**Priority: High**

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement `controllers/reporting.py`
- [ ] Connect report generation to CLI commands
- [ ] Add export functionality (save reports to files)
- [ ] Implement different report formats
- [ ] Test report generation end-to-end

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours

#### 3.3: Advanced Synthesis Features
**Priority: Low**

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add configurable synthesis prompts
- [ ] Implement theme extraction across submissions
- [ ] Add statistical summaries (grade distributions, word count stats)
- [ ] Create synthesis result caching

**Estimated Effort:** 4-5 hours

### Testing & Quality Assurance

#### Integration Testing
**Priority: Medium**

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- [ ] Test complete workflows (create discussion â†’ grade submissions â†’ generate report)
- [ ] Test file system operations with real temporary directories
- [ ] Test CLI commands with real file operations
- [ ] Add performance tests for large submission sets

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours

#### Documentation & Polish
**Priority: Medium**

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Update memory bank files to reflect current reality
- [ ] Create user documentation and examples
- [ ] Add error handling improvements
- [ ] Improve CLI help text and examples
- [ ] Add command completion support

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours

## ðŸš€ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Prioritized)

### Week 1: Complete Phase 2
1. **Interactive Batch Grading** (Day 1-2)
   - Implement clipboard-based text grading
   - Add interactive grading loop
   - Test with real usage scenarios

2. **Complete CLI Integration** (Day 3)
   - Wire up interactive batch command
   - Test all submission workflows
   - Fix any edge cases

### Week 2: Basic Reporting
3. **Report Generation Library** (Day 4-5)
   - Implement basic synthesis functionality
   - Add filtering and grouping
   - Create comprehensive tests

4. **Report CLI Commands** (Day 6-7)
   - Connect reporting to CLI
   - Add export functionality
   - Test complete workflow

## ðŸ“Š CURRENT STATUS SUMMARY

**Overall Progress**: ~75% Complete (much higher than memory bank suggested)

**What Works Right Now:**
- Complete discussion management via CLI
- Single submission grading (both files and text)
- Submission storage and retrieval
- Multiple output formats
- Comprehensive test coverage

**What Users Can Do Today:**
```bash
# Create a discussion
python discussion-grader/grader.py discussion create "Week 1 Discussion" -p 15 -w 250

# Grade a submission file  
python discussion-grader/grader.py submission grade 1 submission1.txt

# List all submissions
python discussion-grader/grader.py submission list 1

# Show submission details
python discussion-grader/grader.py submission show 1 1
```

**What's Missing:**
- Interactive batch grading (the main workflow users expect)
- Report generation and synthesis
- Advanced filtering and bulk operations

## ðŸŽ¯ SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- [x] Create and manage discussions
- [x] Grade individual submissions
- [x] Store and retrieve graded submissions
- [ ] Interactive batch grading mode
- [ ] Basic report generation

### Complete Feature Set
- [x] All MVP features
- [ ] Advanced filtering and search
- [ ] Comprehensive reporting and synthesis
- [ ] Export capabilities
- [ ] Performance optimization for large datasets

The system is much closer to completion than initially thought! The core architecture and grading functionality are solid and well-tested.
