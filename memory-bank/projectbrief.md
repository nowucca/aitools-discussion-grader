# Multi-Discussion Grading System Project Brief

## Project Purpose

The Multi-Discussion Grading System is designed to streamline the process of grading student discussions throughout a semester. It provides a comprehensive tool for Teaching Assistants (TAs) to manage multiple discussions, grade submissions efficiently, and generate insightful reports.

## Core Requirements

1. **Discussion Management**
   - Add new discussions with custom questions
   - Update existing discussions
   - List and organize multiple discussions

2. **Efficient Grading**
   - Grade individual submissions with AI assistance
   - Batch grade multiple submissions
   - Automatic feedback generation
   - Clipboard integration for quick feedback copying

3. **Submission Storage**
   - Store all graded submissions
   - Organize by discussion
   - Track grades and feedback

4. **Synthesis & Reporting**
   - Generate amalgamated "crowd-sourced" responses from student submissions
   - Filter submissions by grade threshold
   - Support for multiple output formats

5. **Command Line Interface**
   - Noun-verb pattern (e.g., `grader discussion create`)
   - Consistent help system
   - Intuitive options and arguments

## Target Users

- **Primary User**: Teaching Assistants (TAs) responsible for grading student discussions
- **Secondary User**: Course Instructors who review grading consistency and student insights

## Success Criteria

1. Supports managing 10+ discussions per semester
2. Reduces grading time by at least 50% compared to manual methods
3. Provides consistent, high-quality feedback across all submissions
4. Generates valuable instructor insights from student submissions
5. Intuitive CLI that follows best practices and is easy to learn

## Constraints

1. Must work with the Anthropic Claude API for AI grading
2. Command-line interface (no GUI)
3. Python-based implementation
4. Support for Markdown formatted submissions and questions
