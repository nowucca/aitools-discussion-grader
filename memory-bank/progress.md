   - ❌ Result formatting options

3. **Output Formats**
   - ❌ Text, JSON, CSV output formats
   - ❌ Format-specific rendering
   - ❌ Clipboard integration for outputs

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Concept to Current Plan

1. **Original System Focus**:
   - Single discussion grading
   - Basic AI integration
   - Simple command-line interface
   - No submission storage

2. **Expanded Vision**:
   - Multi-discussion management
   - Comprehensive storage system
   - Advanced CLI with noun-verb pattern
   - Synthesis capabilities for instructors

3. **Architectural Evolution**:
   - From single-file scripts to layered architecture
   - From ad-hoc functions to organized modules
   - From basic argparse to Click framework
   - From minimal storage to structured filesystem

### Technology Decisions

1. **CLI Framework**:
   - Initial plan: Basic argparse
   - Final decision: Click for better command organization
   - Reasoning: Better support for complex command hierarchies

2. **Storage Mechanism**:
   - Initial plan: Simple file output
   - Final decision: Structured filesystem with JSON metadata
   - Reasoning: Balance of simplicity and organization without database complexity

3. **Testing Approach**:
   - Initial plan: Basic unit tests
   - Final decision: Comprehensive testing with pytest
   - Reasoning: Better maintainability and confidence in changes

4. **Dependency Versioning**:
   - Decision: Use ">=" syntax for version requirements
   - Reasoning: Ensures minimum tested versions while allowing compatibility with newer versions

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **API Dependency**:
   - System requires Anthropic API key
   - Subject to API rate limits and costs
   - May face issues with very large submission volumes

2. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Grading is inherently synchronous due to API interaction
   - Large batches may take significant time to process
   - Synthesis of many submissions faces token limitations

3. **Cross-Platform Considerations**:
   - Clipboard functionality varies by operating system
   - File path handling differences between OS platforms
   - Terminal UI limitations in different environments
